# GenASNRangeScraper
This Python script is designed to retrieve a list of CIDR ranges from a given ASN (Autonomous System Number). The script makes an HTTP request to an IP address service, extracts the CIDR ranges, and saves the results to a file. It also supports data caching to speed up subsequent requests.
